# Spring Data JPA
This project gives a simple overview of the power and the simplicity of the Spring Data JPA.
Spring data JPA still requires a JPA implemetor (like Hibernate) but it reduces the boilerplate code that the developer has to write. 

For more details on the advantages of Spring data JPA, please refer to my blog here [Soumik's blog on Spring data JPA](https://msoumik78.github.io/java/2019/05/25/why-use-spring-data-jpa.html)
